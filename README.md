# for_IBM_Capstone
this is for the work I do for the IBM capstone project

In this study, I analyzed the largest US cities to see if there is a difference in the venue categories in the country.  When I cluster the groups from 5 clusters to 3 clusters.  I did not see a large difference in the visual map.  It seems the venues in the US are very consistence no matter where you go .
During my travels throughout the US, this conclusion seems correct.  When we travel from city to city or state to state in the very large cities in the US, it does seem very similar.

This is my 1st project using Python Pandas, Foursquare and Mapping visualization and felt a learned a great deal about the tools, Next I need to further this project study with more indebt detailed analysis.

As I showed this report to my colleges, some suggestions were made for future studies.
1 -select the top 50 cities around the world
2 â€“ select only the top 10 cities in the US

As I move forward and increase my knowledge with Data Science, I hope to do more projects in this space.
